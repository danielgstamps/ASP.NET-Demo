# ASP.NET-Demo
This project is a database-driven website for a fictional company. The site manages customers, employees, software, and feedback elements from a Microsoft Access database. You may notice that some components of the site use different methods of database manipulation. This is intentional and is meant to showcase my skill set.
To access most parts of the site, you'll need to use the navigation menu in the header. Some pages (such as Maintenance) aren't accessible otherwise. 

Please note that the simplistic visual style of the site does not reflect my best work. This project is all about functionality, rather than appearance.
