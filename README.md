# ASP.NET-Demo
This project is a database-driven website for a fictional company. The site manages customers, employees, software, and feedback elements from a Microsoft Access database. You may notice that some components of the site use different methods of database manipulation. This is intentional and is meant to showcase my skill set.
To access most parts of the site, you'll need to use the navigation in the header. Some pages (such as Maintenance) aren't accessible otherwise.
